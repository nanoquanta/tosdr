Before we assign a class to a service, we should check whether the following topics have been covered:

* Does the service use first-party and/or third-party cookies?
* Can they change the terms at any time?
* Do they claim copyright (or what sort of license) over your content (where applicable)?
* Do you have a right to leave the service?
* Can you export your data (where applicable)?
* How do they work with third parties (contractors they use)?
* How do they work with government requests?
* How do they handle decisions about suspension of your account when they feel you breached the terms?
* Do they (try to) prohibit you from going to court against them?
* What happens to your data when they get acquired or when they shut down the service?
* How long do they keep your private data and what do they use it for?
