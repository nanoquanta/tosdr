### How cases work

When giving a score to each point in a topic, you (as a reviewer/curator) will obviously want to give the same score to "comparable" data points. Say you gave MySpace a 'good (20)' score for the data point that states they give users 24 hours notice before actioning a take-down request, and Facebook also gives the same 24 hours notice in the same situation, then you would want to give that the same 'good (20)' valuation, and not suddenly a different one. That's exactly what a `case` does.

In this example, the topic maybe 'take-down requests', and the 'case' that would apply here to both the MySpace and the Facebook point in this topic would be something like "yes, but with 24 hours notice" -> "good (20)".

Cases are defined in [`scripts/cases.js`](https://github.com/tosdr/tosdr.org/blob/master/scripts/cases.js).
