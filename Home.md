## Convert mailing list discussions to put on the website
Here’s how you can help!

### JSONify list threads
When you find something relevant in the mailing list that should become a data point:

1. Create a file in /points that matches the mailing list thread (Please read the documentation about the JSON format for points in [/points/README.md](https://github.com/didnotread/didnotread.org/blob/master/points/README.md))
2. Run 'node buildIndexes.js' inside the repository directory
3. Make sure the service(s) you reference in the points file exist as a json file in /services, and the topic you assign should exist in /topics

(If you can't get the script to run, then just only create the points files, commit and push, and we’ll debug it afterwards.)


### Progress

Please put your name next to the ML thread you are JSONifying, then we can work through the list together. when done, strike it through, with a note 'done' behind it.
